Before picking this up, I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a book praising the man from beginning to end; but I was wrong. I think there&amp;rsquo;s a halo effect surrounding Steve Jobs (and I&amp;rsquo;m part of the club, too) that the man didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything wrong. He was all innovation and perfection. But that&amp;rsquo;s just partly true. He was a human being after all and did what all human beings do."><meta name=keywords content><meta name=robots content="noodp"><link rel=canonical href=https://masoudkarimif.github.io/posts/my-favorite-reads-of-2024/><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.googleapis.com><link rel=preconnect href=https://fonts.gstatic.com crossorigin><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Code&display=swap" rel=stylesheet><link rel=stylesheet href=https://masoudkarimif.github.io/style.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon-precomposed sizes=144x144 href=https://masoudkarimif.github.io/img/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png><link rel="shortcut icon" href=https://masoudkarimif.github.io/img/favicon.png><link href=/fonts/Inter-Italic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Regular.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Medium.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-MediumItalic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-Bold.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><link href=/fonts/Inter-BoldItalic.woff2 rel=preload type=font/woff2 as=font crossorigin><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="My Favorite Reads of 2024"><meta name=twitter:description content="Out of the books I read in 2024, here are the ones I liked the most."><meta property="og:url" content="https://masoudkarimif.github.io/posts/my-favorite-reads-of-2024/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="masoudkf"><meta property="og:title" content="My Favorite Reads of 2024"><meta property="og:description" content="Out of the books I read in 2024, here are the ones I liked the most."><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="posts"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2024-12-31T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-12-31T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Books"><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ZFRSZRJSCV"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-ZFRSZRJSCV")}</script></head><body class=light-theme><div class=container><header class=header><span class=header__inner><a href=/ class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg>

<a href=#steve-jobs class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>by <em>Walter Isaacson</em></p><br><p align=center><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1735763002/steve-jobs_g4zklz.jpg></p><br><p>Before picking this up, I thought it&rsquo;d be a book praising the man from beginning to end; but I was wrong. I think there&rsquo;s a halo effect surrounding Steve Jobs (and I&rsquo;m part of the club, too) that the man didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. He was all innovation and perfection. But that&rsquo;s just partly true. He was a human being after all and did what all human beings do. He was a jerk to a lot of people around him, including his immediate family; he lied at times like everybody else; and he also failed on a number of projects (MobileMe, for one).</p><p>As Isaacson points out at the end, it&rsquo;s important to understand a person as a whole and not focus on a few good or bad traits. He mentions in the book that some people take the bad ones and think of themselves as the next Steve Jobs: &ldquo;You know, I do the same thing. I&rsquo;m often a jerk to my employees, too.&rdquo; But they forget Jobs&rsquo; genius and innovations.</p><p>Jobs was a legend and will always be remembered as such. At the same time, it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that he also made mistakes (both in his career and personal life) and try to avoid them as much as we can. Otherwise, what&rsquo;s the point of reading biographies and memoirs?</p><h4 id=some-quotes-i-liked>Some Quotes I Liked
<a href=#some-quotes-i-liked class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><blockquote><p>Unlike other product developers, Jobs did not believe the customer was always right; if they wanted to resist using a mouse, they were wrong.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It’s not done until it ships.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=meditations>Meditations
<a href=#meditations class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>by <em>Marcus Aurelius</em>; translation by <em>Gregory Hays</em></p><br><p align=center><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1735764054/meditations_foj7h0.jpg></p><br><p>What makes the book fascinating is that Marcus Aurelius wrote these notes for himself, not for anyone else. This gives the book significant credibility. When you&rsquo;re talking to yourself, you&rsquo;re honest; you don&rsquo;t mince words, try to impress others, lie to sound smart, or hide embarrassing thoughts. You&rsquo;re your most authentic self when talking to yourself.</p><p>The notes focus on living a better life, free from envy, anger, and other harmful emotions. They emphasize letting things go and preventing them from harming you: &ldquo;Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed.&rdquo;</p><p>However, Marcus Aurelius was a religious man and a strong believer in the gods (primarily Zeus). So, If you&rsquo;re not a religious person, you may find some of the notes less applicable to your life.</p><h4 id=some-quotes-i-liked-1>Some Quotes I Liked
<a href=#some-quotes-i-liked-1 class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h4><blockquote><p>Everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.</p></blockquote><hr><h2 id=flatland-a-romance-of-many-dimensions>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions
<a href=#flatland-a-romance-of-many-dimensions class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h2><p>by <em>Edwin A. Abbott</em></p><br><p align=center><img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/mkf/image/upload/v1735764608/flatland_onxrst.jpg></p><br><p>An interesting tale about lands of different dimensions: Point, Flat, and SpaceLand. My main take from the text is that expanding your horizons (or dimensions) can show how little we truly know about our universe. A King in PointLand is considered foolish in FlatLand because he doesn&rsquo;t know anything of the world beyond his Point of existence. With the same token, there might be four-dimensional people currently laughing at our ignorance. I hope I&rsquo;ll be there when the first contact happens.</p><h4 id=some-quotes-i-liked-2>Some Quotes I Liked
