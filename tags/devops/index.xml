Gatsby is a super-fast static website generator that&amp;rsquo;s been getting a lot of attention lately. For one, this very website was (proudly) made with Gatsby. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with it, I encourage you to definitely check it out; spoiler alert: it&amp;rsquo;s awesome. For one, it uses React which we love! (By the way, React website itself was made with Gatsby)
This post is not about how to build Gatsby websites; rather, it&amp;rsquo;s on how you can create a CI/CD pipeline and deploy your Gatsby website on AWS.</description></item></channel></rss>
