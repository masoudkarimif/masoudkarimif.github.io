## Introduction

For every software project, we need a tool to keep our files safe, retain a history of changes, attribute those changes to their authors, and have a seamless collaboration between team members. We also want the tool to be fast and easy to use. Git delivers all that.

A Git project is referred to as a "repository," which contains the complete history of the project from the beginning. A repository consists of individual snapshots called "commits." A single commit includes:

#### The project tree
A structure of nested files and directories representing a complete state of the project:

```bash
project
│   README.md
│   file001.txt    
│
└───folder1
│   │   file011.txt
│   │   file012.txt
│   │
│   └───subfolder1
│       │   file111.txt
│       │   file112.txt
│       │   ...
│   
└───folder2
    │   file021.txt
    │   file022.txt
```

#### The "author" 
Name, email address, and date/time indicating who made the changes that resulted in this project state and when.

#### The "committer"
The same information about the person who added this commit to the repository (which may be different from the author).

*Note*: author and committer will refer to the same person if you're working on a Git project alone. In group projects, however, they could refer to different people (or even bots!).

#### A "commit message"

Text used to comment on the changes made by the commit.

The following figure shows a Git project containing one branch (Main) and 4 snapshots (commits).

## Download and Install Git

First, there's a chance you already have Git installed on your system. To make sure, open up a Terminal (command-line) and try this command:

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a Git version showing up, you can skip this step. If not, refer to [this tutorial](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) on how to install Git based on your operating system.

---

## Turning a Folder Into a Git Project

In order to turn a folder into a Git project, first `cd` to the folder in your Terminal: `cd /your/folder`. Then run `git init`. If successful, the folder is now tracked via Git. You should also be able to see a hidden folder named `.git` in your root directory: `ls -la`.

---

## Create Snapshots (commits)

In order to create snapshots in a Git project, you need to first *stage* your changes, as commits only create snapshots of the changes already staged within a project. To stage a file, run `git add <file-name>`. You can also use the handy `git add -A` command to stage everything in the project. To create a snapshot of staged files and folders, use the `git commit -m "commit message"` command. The commit message could be anything, but it's highly recommended to put something meaningful, especially if you're working in a team, as it makes it easier to follow changes later.

---

## Check the Status of a Project

You can use the `git status` to check the status of a project. Note that you need to be inside the Git project for the command to work. Here's a sample output of the command:

```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   git-101/README.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        git-101/images/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

It tells you which branch you are currently on (`main` in this case); files not staged yet; and files not being tracked at the moment. To stage a file, or start tracking a file, use the `git add <file-name>` command.

---

## Branches

When you first turn a directory to a Git project, Git will create a branch named `main` for you (you can list your branches by using the `git branch` command). Changes you make (almost) always happen on a branch. A branch is simply a pointer to a commit. That commit in turn can point to a parent commit, then another parent commit, etc.

Branches are very important when working in a team. We create branches (or branch off an existing branch, as they say) to work on a new feature, bug fix, etc. while at the same time not interfering with other teammates' works on other branches. When finished, we will merge our branch to a main branch. Note that I said *a* main branch and not *the* `main` branch. In a real-world scenario, typically, there are multiple main branches associated with different environments (for instance: `dev`, `staging`, and `production`). A main branch is a branch that once merged into, will usually trigger a deployment process and change the state of an environment.


In order to create a branch, you can use the `git branch <branch-name>` command. Note that this will not change the current branch for you. You also need to checkout to the branch using the `git checkout <branch-name>`. There's also a handy command: `git checkout -b <branch-name>` which will create the branch and checkout to it in one step.

## Remote Repository

Remote repository is a server that holds a central copy of your local repository. A central or remote repository is key to working efficiently in a team, as each team member can `pull` the latest changes from the central repository and `push` their changes to it. The following figure shows a central (remote) repository and two collaborators working as a team.

<br/>

It's convention to name the remote repository `origin`. To pull the latest changes from the remote repo, use `git pull origin <branch-name>`, and to push your changes to the remote repo, use `git push origin <branch-name>`.

---

## Pull Request

A Pull Request (or PR for short) is request to merge your branch (including your latest changes) to a remote branch. Although you may be able to push directly into a branch without creating a PR first, it's always recommended to do so when you're working in a team, as PRs allow collaborators to discuss the changes before merging.
