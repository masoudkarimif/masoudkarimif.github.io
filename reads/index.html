<a href=#code-simplicity-the-fundamentals-of-software class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p align=center style="float:left;margin:0 20px 10px 0"><img src=https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514tZi6ZbsL._SX375_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg alt="Code Simplicity" width=200></p><p>This is a short book on—as the title suggests—writing simple code, as the root cause of every problem in software is complexity.</p><p>The main purpose of any software, the author believes, is to help people. Therefore, your ability to write good code is determined by your ability to imagine ways to assist others. Speaking from experience, that makes sense. Every developer I’ve seen writing bad code—and by bad I mean code that can’t be understood easily by others and is hard to be changed in the future—has written code for themselves, not for others. Some even put extra effort to make their code less readable as they think—wrongly, of course—that it would make them irreplaceable at their company. So, if you’re an engineering manager and find a developer who writes bad code and never makes an effort to improve, you need to make a decision sooner rather than later.</p><p>Max also argues that “It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.” The reason is that most software systems are maintained for a long time, therefore the effort of implementation becomes less and less significant; the effort of maintenance, on the other hand, is what really matters. So, write code that’s easy to maintain even if it takes you more time to write it. How? Follow software development best practices such as DRY and SOLID, and most importantly, make your code as simple as possible; or as Max puts it, “dumb simple.”</p><p>All in all, this is a great book. However, if you&rsquo;re looking for code samples, you&rsquo;re not going to find that many.</p><hr><h3 id=a-philosophy-of-software-design>A Philosophy of Software Design
<a href=#a-philosophy-of-software-design class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h3><p align=center style="float:left;margin:0 20px 10px 0"><img src=https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1531857377i/39996759.jpg alt="A Philosophy of Software Design" width=200></p><p>I disagree with the author when it comes to comments in your code. Not only Ousterhout does believe in having comments in almost everywhere in your code&ndash;interfaces, implementations, configs&ndash;he goes so far as to suggest a Comment Driven Design (CDD)&ndash;although that&rsquo;s the name I gave to his principle; it&rsquo;s not what he calls it.</p><p>In his view, it&rsquo;s a good practice to start designing a program by writing comments about what different parts should do, and then implementing them. Comments, as
Max Kanat-Alexander puts it, should only describe &ldquo;why&rdquo; we&rsquo;re doing what we&rsquo;re doing, and not &ldquo;what&rdquo; we&rsquo;re doing; that should be clear from the code itself. If it&rsquo;s not, improve your code and make it more readable. I&rsquo;m with Max on this.</p><p>The book also focuses on OOP, so you&rsquo;ll enjoy this book more than I did if you like that paradigm.</p></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><a href=/ class=logo style=text-decoration:none><span class=logo__mark><svg class="greater-icon" viewBox="0 0 44 44"><path fill="none" d="M15 8l14.729 14.382L15 35.367"/></svg>
