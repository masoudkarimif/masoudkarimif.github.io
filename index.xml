The JADE Agent class&amp;mdash;which your agents must extend in order to be recognized by the system as an actual agent&amp;mdash;offers the minimum functionality. Although it's totally fine, there's no harm in adding a couple more features to it. The ones I think many agents would like to have right from the start. Here's a simple suggestion.</description></item><item><title>Gatsby on AWS: Creating a CI/CD Pipeline</title><link>https://masoudkarimif.github.io/posts/aws-cicd-pipeline-for-gatsby/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://masoudkarimif.github.io/posts/aws-cicd-pipeline-for-gatsby/</guid><description>

As far as web servers are concerned, React routes are fake routes. They do not follow the traditional file/folder hierarchy. They're just different components being mounted/unmounted by React at different times. Selling these fake routes as actual routes to Apache and Express.js is what this post is all about.</description></item><item><title>Preparing Your S3 Bucket to Host a Static Website Using AWS CLI</title><link>https://masoudkarimif.github.io/posts/s3-static-website/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://masoudkarimif.github.io/posts/s3-static-website/</guid><description>
Your S3 bucket is more versatile than it actually looks. For one, it can host a static website with an actuall domain name. There are, however, a couple of steps to take before your static site is up and running.

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This book contains a series of short essays on everything related to Software Engineering. Compared to Max&amp;rsquo;s other book, Code Simplicity, this one is bigger, more comprehensive, and hence, covers more topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I had to pick only one thing from the book, it&amp;rsquo;d be: the difference between an average and a rockstar programmer is understanding. &amp;ldquo;All you have to do to become an excellent programmer is fully understand what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&amp;rdquo; It may seem obvious and non-revolutionary at first sight, but speaking from experience, it is as important as it&amp;rsquo;s true. As the author puts it, &amp;ldquo;The vast majority (90% or more) of programmers have absolutely no idea what they are doing.&amp;rdquo; Therefore, the code they write is hard to read, maintain, and debug. Examples of violating this principle that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen include but are certainly not limited to: not using joins when working with relational databases and performing the joins in the code (not understanding relational databases); using asynchronous programming in CPU-intensive applications to boost performance (not understanding async programming and when to use it); and using Python threads to achieve parallel computing (not understanding the Python GIL).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
